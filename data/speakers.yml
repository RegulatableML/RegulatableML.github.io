  talk_title: "Observations at the Intersection of Privacy and Machine Learning"
  abstract: "Privacy presents a distinctive set of challenges in machine learning risk management. This talk will explore the intersection of privacy and ML risks, highlighting key barriers to effective risk management. Drawing from recent work at the NIST Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs Testbed), the talk will examine the challenges of identifying and mitigating privacy risks in ML systems. Through specific examples from recent red teaming exercises, I will illustrate the complexities of managing privacy risks in ML, including issues related to data minimization, model interpretability, and adversarial attacks.  The observations will inform a discussion on the need for a nuanced and multidisciplinary approach to approaching privacy-related ML risks."

  talk_title: "Guarding the Age of Agents: Advancing Risk Assessment, Guardrails, and Security Certification"
  abstract: "Autonomous agents built on foundation models are increasingly being deployed in dynamic, high-stakes real-world environments—from web automation to AI operating systems. Despite their promise, these agents remain highly susceptible to adversarial instructions and manipulation, posing serious risks including policy violations, data leakage, and financial harm. \n In this talk, I will present a comprehensive framework for assessing and strengthening the safety of AI agents. We begin by examining principles and methodologies for robust agent evaluation, with a focus on red teaming-based stress testing across diverse adversarial scenarios, ranging from agent poisoning to WebAgent manipulation to general blackbox agent attacks. Building on these foundations, I will introduce Shield Agent, the first guardrail agent explicitly designed to enforce policy-aligned behavior in autonomous agents through structured reasoning and verification. Shield agent constructs a verifiable safety model by extracting and encoding actionable safety rules from formal AI security policy documents into probabilistic graphical rule circuits. Given a target agent’s action trajectory, Shield agent dynamically retrieves relevant safety rules and synthesizes shielding strategies by building a rich tool library and formally executable code. To support comprehensive AI agent evaluations, I will also introduce a novel benchmark comprising 3,000 safety-critical instruction-action pairs derived from state-of-the-art attack scenarios across six web environments and seven distinct risk categories. \n This talk aims to highlight both the urgent challenges and emerging solutions in building trustworthy, resilient AI agents—hoping to lay the groundwork for a new generation of safety-aligned autonomous systems."
