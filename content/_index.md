# Overview

Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in applications that significantly impact our daily lives, leading to the proposal or implementation of regulatory principles worldwide. Despite these efforts, a considerable gap exists between state-of-the-art ML research and regulatory principles, which may arise from the difficulty in translating policies into algorithmic implementations, the uncertainty of technical feasibility, and inherent tensions between different regulatory principles.

This workshop aims to provide a platform for: i) discussing various algorithmic, technical, and policy challenges that arise when operationalizing various guidelines outlined in existing regulatory frameworks, and ii) finding solutions to mitigate and address these challenges.


# Call for Papers
The goal of this workshop is to initiate a dialogue about identifying and bridging the gaps between ML research and regulatory principles. To this end, we encourage paper submissions relevant to (but not limited to) the following topics:
- Theoretical and/or empirical studies to highlight the operational gaps between existing regulations and SOTA ML research;
- Evaluation and auditing frameworks for ensuring that ML models are in compliance with regulatory guidelines;
- Theoretical and/or empirical studies to highlight tensions between different desiderata (e.g., fairness, explainability, privacy) of ML models outlined by various regulatory frameworks;
- Novel algorithmic frameworks to operationalize the right to explanation, the right to privacy, the right to be forgotten, and to ensure fairness and robustness of ML models.
