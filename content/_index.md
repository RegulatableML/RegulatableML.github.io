# Overview

With the increasing deployment of machine learning in diverse applications affecting our daily lives, ethical and legal implications are rising to the forefront. Governments worldwide have responded by implementing regulatory policies to safeguard algorithmic decisions and data usage practices. However, there appears to be a considerable gap between current machine learning research and these regulatory policies. Translating these policies into algorithmic implementations is highly non-trivial, and there may be inherent tensions between different regulatory principles.

This workshop aims to provide a platform for: i) discussing various algorithmic, technical, and policy challenges that arise when operationalizing various guidelines outlined in existing regulatory frameworks, and ii) finding solutions to mitigate and address these challenges.
